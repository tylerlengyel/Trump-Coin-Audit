# Transaction Errors

This document captures errors and issues identified while analyzing recent transactions for the Solana token.

---

## **Observed Errors**

### 1. **InstructionError**
- **Description**: Multiple transactions contain `InstructionError`. This type of error indicates a problem with a specific instruction in the transaction.
- **Examples**:
  - Transaction `YTwztiLJ11ayrLvdLNxvJ8YEcjL51iFnDwNWkCfhhwTAEVhqYsp1bogY5QFA38oosmtAcWm6mo8orqqSMfzRxju`
    - **Error Code**: `MinReturnNotReached`
    - **Message**: The expected minimum return for a swap was not achieved.
    - **Cause**: Likely due to slippage during swaps or misconfiguration of the routing parameters.
  - Transaction `5AaeSjDp7hLYESi2UF5EGjkD9rKJmRL8qqTFcB1Z9hoP91HE8GhpFmo7vrrf1h7mcJABnL6UvixXu8gMpF5kpCXo`
    - **Error Code**: `InstructionError: [Custom Error]`
    - **Message**: Undefined error from a custom program.

## **Potential Causes**
1. **Dex Aggregator Routing Issues**:
   - Certain swaps may fail due to insufficient liquidity, incorrect routing paths, or poor price impact management.
   
2. **Invalid Parameters**:
   - Incorrect or overly strict parameters (e.g., minimum return) may cause transactions to fail.

3. **Smart Contract Issues**:
   - Errors in custom programs or logic used for processing transactions could lead to failures.

4. **Concurrency**:
   - High transaction volume might cause nonce-related issues or delays that lead to failure.

## **Recommendations**

1. **Verify Slippage Tolerance**:
   - Ensure that slippage tolerance is set appropriately in the programs and transactions. 

2. **Test Smart Contract Logic**:
   - Debug and test the logic of custom smart contracts for edge cases and vulnerabilities.

3. **Liquidity Monitoring**:
   - Monitor liquidity pools to ensure sufficient depth for large transactions.

4. **Upgrade Program Transparency**:
   - Clarify upgrade authority to avoid unauthorized changes to the program.

## **Further Steps**
- Analyze more transactions to identify recurring patterns or errors.
- Engage with the development team of the program for clarification on error causes.
- Open-source this repository to allow community contributions for further analysis.
