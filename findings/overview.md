# Overview of Findings

This document summarizes the key vulnerabilities and risks identified during the audit of the Solana token.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Upgradeable Program
The program is upgradeable, and the upgrade authority is unknown. This poses a significant risk as malicious code could replace the current program logic.

### 2. Failed Transactions
Several transactions failed due to `InstructionError`. These errors could indicate inefficiencies or potential exploits in program logic.

### 3. Centralization Risks
The lack of transparency around the upgrade authority and program ownership raises concerns about centralization.

### 4. Missing Metadata
The absence of a metadata URI suggests incomplete or missing information about the token, which could erode user trust.

### 5. Token Interactions in Liquidity Pools
The token interacts with liquidity programs like Jupiter. Risks include slippage, inefficiencies, and potential exploits in unverified routing programs.

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Upgrade Authority**:
   - Determine the program's upgrade authority and ensure it is decentralized or nullified.

2. **Analyze Transaction Errors**:
   - Review failed transactions to identify recurring issues and root causes.

3. **Enhance Transparency**:
   - Request public documentation, audits, and team verification for the project.

4. **Monitor Liquidity Pools**:
   - Continuously check liquidity reserves and routing programs for anomalies.
