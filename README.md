# Trump-Coin-Audit

This repository documents an independent audit of a Solana SPL token to identify potential vulnerabilities and risks. The token's total supply is approximately 1 billion, and it interacts with several decentralized applications (DApps) and liquidity pools on Solana.

## Findings

### Token Details
- **Token Type**: SPL Token
- **Supply**: 999,999,990.838456
- **Mint Authority**: None
- **Freeze Authority**: None
- **Metadata URI**: None (No additional information about the token)

### Key Risks and Vulnerabilities
1. **Upgradeable Program**
   - The program is upgradeable, and its upgrade authority is unknown.
   - Risks:
     - Unauthorized modifications to program logic.
     - Potential for rug pulls if malicious code is uploaded.

2. **Failed Transactions**
   - Several transactions with `InstructionError` were identified.
   - Possible issues with swaps, liquidity pools, or program logic.

3. **Centralization Risks**
   - The upgrade authority may be centralized, making the project susceptible to misuse or compromise.

4. **Liquidity Pool Interactions**
   - The token interacts with DEX aggregators like Jupiter and other liquidity programs.
   - Risks:
     - Slippage or inefficiencies in routing.
     - Exploits in unverified liquidity programs.

### Recommendations
- Verify the programâ€™s upgrade authority and ensure it is decentralized or nullified.
- Analyze failed transactions to identify root causes.
- Contact the project team for transparency about metadata and program ownership.
- Avoid large investments until risks are mitigated.
- Monitor liquidity pool interactions for unusual behavior.
